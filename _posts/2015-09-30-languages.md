A question that comes up often is which frameworks and technologies to learn to be prepared for the future. Frameworks and technologies have short lifespans. Languages last longer and give a broader understanding of computer science. A good software engineer is versed in multiple languages. C for close to machine programming, pointers, memory; Ada for strong typing, design by contract; Java/C# for object-oriented programming; Python/Ruby for general purpose, expressive programming; Lisp/Clojure for functional programming, macros.

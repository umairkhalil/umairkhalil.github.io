A question that comes up often is what is great software. Software interacts with three types of entities:

- machine (development machine, hosting machine, client machine, network)
- developer (software engineer, tester, administrator, support)
- user (end user)

Great Software is optimized for the machine, easy to read and maintain for the developer and aesthetically pleasing and easy to use for the user.
